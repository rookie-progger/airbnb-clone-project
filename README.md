## Project Roles and Responsibilities

Clearly defining roles ensures effective collaboration, accountability, and smooth project execution. Below are the core roles involved in the Airbnb Clone Project:

| Role               | Responsibilities                                                                                      |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Project Manager** | Oversees planning, scheduling, and coordination. Tracks progress, manages risks, and ensures deadlines are met. |
| **Frontend Developers** | Build user interfaces using React.js and Tailwind CSS. Ensure responsiveness, accessibility, and performance. |
| **Backend Developers** | Develop server-side logic, REST APIs, and database management. Handle authentication, business logic, and data flow. |
| **Designers (UI/UX)** | Create mockups, design systems, and user flows in Figma. Ensure a visually pleasing and user-friendly experience. |
| **QA/Testers**        | Test functionalities, perform bug reporting, and verify features meet acceptance criteria. Conduct manual and automated tests. |
| **DevOps Engineers**  | Set up CI/CD pipelines, manage deployments, monitor environments, and ensure system scalability and uptime. |
| **Product Owner**     | Defines the product vision and feature priorities. Writes user stories and ensures the product meets business goals. |
| **Scrum Master**      | Facilitates Agile ceremonies (sprints, standups, retrospectives). Removes blockers and ensures team follows Agile principles. |

### ü§ù Contribution to Project Success

Each role is crucial:
- Developers bring functionality to life.
- Designers ensure usability and appeal.
- QA/Testers maintain quality and reliability.
- DevOps ensures smooth deployment.
- Product Owner provides direction.
- Scrum Master and PM ensure everyone works efficiently and collaboratively.

Together, these roles ensure the project is delivered **on time**, **within scope**, and **to the highest quality standards**.


A user-friendly design is essential in a booking platform because it directly influences trust, conversion rates, and repeat usage. Complex or confusing interfaces can lead to user drop-offs and booking abandonment. A smooth, intuitive experience ensures users can confidently find, evaluate, and book accommodations without frustration. Accessibility, responsiveness, and visual clarity build credibility and increase engagement.
